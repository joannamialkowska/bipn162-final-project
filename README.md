# bipn162-final-project
Final Project For Bipn162


For this project we integrate three datasets gene expression, electrophysiological and morphological to explore the diversity of MGE-derived interneurons. This is derived from Scala et al.’s paper “Phenotypic variation of transcriptomic cell types in mouse motor cortex.” While we use raw gene expression data linked to the paper, we take advantage of the authors’ processing of  Patch-seq data to access electrophysiological and morphological features: https://github.com/berenslab/mini-atlas/tree/master.
